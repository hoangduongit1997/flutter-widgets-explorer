# flutter-widgets-explorer

The Flutter Widgets Explorer project is created to learn, test and demo flutter widgets.

## Getting Started

The first screen launched in the app is a list of widget names. 
After select a widget name, the selected widget details will show on next screen.
<p> 
<img alt="Main Screen" src="images/main.png" height="480px" width="270px" />

Each widget will be coded in separate branch and come with it's own readme file.

## Branches:
